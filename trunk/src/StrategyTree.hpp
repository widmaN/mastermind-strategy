/**
 * Represents a guessing strategy of the code breaker.
 *
 * The strategy is internally stored as a tree. Each node in the tree
 * represents a <i>state</i> (or situation) of the game. Each state
 * is identified by a sequence of constraints consisting of the guesses
 * made and responses received so far. The constraints are read from
 * the root node to the given node.
 *
 * For example,
 * [Root] <- this state contains all the codewords
 *   [1234:0A0B] <- this state contains the parent state filtered by
 *                  1234:0A0B
 *     ...
 *     [3456:1A0B] <- this state contains the parent state filtered
 *                    by 3456:1A0B
 *     ...
 *
 * When we build a strategy tree, we use a recursive algorithm which always
 * appends a node or branch to the end of the tree. This is critical for
 * enabling a simple storage pattern. That is, we can store the nodes of the
 * tree linearly in a vector; the structure of the tree is identified by the
 * depth field associated with each node. This simple storage scheme makes
 * the implementation robust and efficient, though perhaps a bit less
 * straightforward than an implementation using linked-lists and pointers.
 *
 * A complete strategy tree starts from the initial state (with empty guess
 * and response); a partial strategy tree starts from a certain state of the
 * game (with at least one guess/response pairs). The root depth of the tree
 * or branch is also stored for integrity-checking purpose.
