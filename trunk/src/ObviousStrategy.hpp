/**
 * Strategy that makes an obviously-optimal guess when one exists.
 *
 * This is an example (but useful) strategy that implements the @c
 * Strategy interface. This strategy returns an obviously-optimal
 * guess if one exists. If such a guess is not found, it returns
 * failure. Therefore, this strategy cannot be used alone to break
 * a code; instead it serves as a quick check before other more
 * sophisticated (and time consuming) strategies are applied.
 *
 * An obviously-optimal guess is a guess (which may or may not be
 * in the remaining possibilities) that partitions the possibility
 * set into discrete cells, i.e. where every cell contains exactly
 * one element. If such a guess exists and comes from the possibility
 * set, then it is optimal because it reveals one secret in the
 * immediate step and reveals all the rest in two steps. If no such
 * guess exists in the possibility set but one exists outside the
 * possibility set, then that one is optimal because it reverals
 * all secrets in two steps.
 *
 * A necessary condition for an obviously-optimal guess to exist
 * is that the number of remaining possibilities is no more than
 * the number of distinct feedbacks. For a game with @c p pegs,
 * the number of distinct feedbacks is <code>p*(p+3)/2</code>.
 *
 * If the maximum depth (i.e. number of guesses) to reveal each secret
 * is not restricted, an additional observation can be made. If there
 * exists no guess in the remaining possibilities that can partition
 * @c n remaining possibilities into @c n singleton cells, but there
 * exists one guess in the remaining possibilities that partitions the
 * remaining possibilities into <code>(n-2)</code> singleton cells
 * and one cell with 2 secrets, then this guess achieves the minimum
 * number of total steps, which is equal to @c n. However, it would
 * require two extra guesses in the worst case; there might exist a
 * non-possible guess that partitions the remaining possibilities into
 * singleton cells and thus requires only one extra guess.
